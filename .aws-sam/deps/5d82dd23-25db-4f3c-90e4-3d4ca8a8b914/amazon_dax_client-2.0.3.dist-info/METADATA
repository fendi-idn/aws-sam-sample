Amazon DAX Client for Python
============================

The Amazon DAX Client for Python is used to access `Amazon DAX`_ clusters from
Python. It is nearly source-compatible with Boto3, with only a small change
needed to the client initialization to use DAX instead of DynamoDB.
Creating a connection to your DAX cluster requires using the cluster discovery endpoint URL returned
in the DescribeClusters response as the endpoint.

.. _`Amazon DAX`: https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/

Installation
------------
Install Amazon DAX Client using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install amazon-dax-client

Quick Start
-----------
Boto3 has two different interfaces, the *resource interface* and the botocore
*client interface*. Both are supported by the Amazon DAX client, with slightly
different client initialization.

For the resource API, change from:

.. code-block:: python

    ddb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

to

.. code-block:: python

    dax = AmazonDaxClient.resource(
        endpoint_url=<cluster_discovery_endpoint_url>)

All other ``boto3.resource()`` arguments are accepted.

For the botocore client API, change from:

.. code-block:: python

    session = botocore.session.get_session()
    ddb = session.create_client('dynamodb', ...)

to

.. code-block:: python

    session = botocore.session.get_session()
    dax = AmazonDaxClient(session, ...)

For Boto3 client API, change from:

.. code-block:: python

    ddb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

to

.. code-block:: python

    dax = AmazonDaxClient(endpoint_url=<cluster_discovery_endpoint_url>)

The Boto3 and botocore client APIs are exactly the same.

Hostname Verification for TLS connections is enabled by default when making requests from the client to the cluster
and has no effect for unencrypted clusters. This can be turned off using the client API, be sure you understand the
implication of turning it off, which is the inability to authenticate the cluster that you are connecting to.

Unsupported Features
--------------------
The Amazon DAX client does not support table operations. Any table manipulation
operations must use the regular Boto3 or botocore DynamoDB client.

Paginators are not currently supported for DAX.

Documentation
-------------
Once created, the interface is the same as the Boto3/botocore DynamoDB clients.
